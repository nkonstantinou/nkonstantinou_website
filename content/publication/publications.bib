abstract = {Load Theory of attention suggests that high perceptual load in a task leads to reduced sensory visual cortex response to task-unrelated stimuli resulting in "load-induced blindness" [e.g., Lavie, N. Attention, distraction and cognitive control under load. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 19, 143-148, 2010; Lavie, N. Distracted and confused?: Selective attention under load. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 75-82, 2005]. Consideration of the findings that visual {STM} ({VSTM}) involves sensory recruitment [e.g., Pasternak, T., \& Greenlee, M. Working memory in primate sensory systems. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 6, 97-107, 2005] within Load Theory led us to a new hypothesis regarding the effects of {VSTM} load on visual processing. If {VSTM} load draws on sensory visual capacity, then similar to perceptual load, high {VSTM} load should also reduce visual cortex response to incoming stimuli leading to a failure to detect them. We tested this hypothesis with {fMRI} and behavioral measures of visual detection sensitivity. Participants detected the presence of a contrast increment during the maintenance delay in a {VSTM} task requiring maintenance of color and position. Increased {VSTM} load (manipulated by increased set size) led to reduced retinotopic visual cortex (V1-V3) responses to contrast as well as reduced detection sensitivity, as we predicted. Additional visual detection experiments established a clear tradeoff between the amount of information maintained in {VSTM} and detection sensitivity, while ruling out alternative accounts for the effects of {VSTM} load in terms of differential spatial allocation strategies or task difficulty. These findings extend Load Theory to demonstrate a new form of competitive interactions between early visual cortex processing and visual representations held in memory under load and provide a novel line of support for the sensory recruitment hypothesis of {VSTM}.}

abstract = {What is the relationship between attention and conscious awareness? Awareness sometimes appears to be restricted to the contents of focused attention, yet at other times irrelevant distractors will dominate awareness. This contradictory relationship has also been reflected in an abundance of discrepant research findings leading to an enduring controversy in cognitive psychology. Lavie's load theory of attention suggests that the puzzle can be solved by considering the role of perceptual load. Although distractors will intrude upon awareness in conditions of low load, awareness will be restricted to the content of focused attention when the attended information involves high perceptual load. Here, we review recent evidence for this proposal with an emphasis on the various subjective blindness phenomena, and their neural correlates, induced by conditions of high perceptual load. We also present novel findings that clarify the role of attention in the response to stimulus contrast. Overall, this article demonstrates a critical role for perceptual load across the spectrum of perceptual processes leading to awareness, from the very early sensory responses related to contrast detection to explicit recognition of semantic content.}

abstract = {Working memory is responsible for keeping information in mind when it is no longer in view, linking perception with higher cognitive functions. Despite such crucial role, short-term maintenance of visual information is severely limited. Research suggests that capacity limits in visual short-term memory ({VSTM}) are correlated with sustained activity in distinct brain areas. Here, we investigated whether variability in the structure of the brain is reflected in individual differences of behavioral capacity estimates for spatial and object {VSTM}. Behavioral capacity estimates were calculated separately for spatial and object information using a novel adaptive staircase procedure and were found to be unrelated, supporting domain-specific {VSTM} capacity limits. Voxel-based morphometry ({VBM}) analyses revealed dissociable neuroanatomical correlates of spatial versus object {VSTM}. Interindividual variability in spatial {VSTM} was reflected in the gray matter density of the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, object {VSTM} was reflected in the gray matter density of the left insula. These dissociable findings highlight the importance of considering domain-specific estimates of {VSTM} capacity and point to the crucial brain regions that limit {VSTM} capacity for different types of visual information.

abstract = {We establish a new dissociation between the roles of working memory ({WM}) cognitive control and visual maintenance in selective attention as measured by the efficiency of distractor rejection. The extent to which focused selective attention can prevent distraction has been shown to critically depend on the level and type of load involved in the task. High perceptual load that consumes perceptual capacity leads to reduced distractor processing, whereas high {WM} load that reduces {WM} ability to exert priority-based executive cognitive control over the task results in increased distractor processing (e.g., Lavie, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9(2), 75-82, 2005). {WM} also serves to maintain task-relevant visual representations, and such visual maintenance is known to recruit the same sensory cortices as those involved in perception (e.g., Pasternak \& Greenlee, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 6(2), 97-107, 2005). These findings led us to hypothesize that loading {WM} with visual maintenance would reduce visual capacity involved in perception, thus resulting in reduced distractor processing-similar to perceptual load and opposite to {WM} cognitive control load. Distractor processing was assessed in a response competition task, presented during the memory interval (or during encoding; Experiment 1a) of a {WM} task. Loading visual maintenance or encoding by increased set size for a memory sample of shapes, colors, and locations led to reduced distractor response competition effects. In contrast, loading {WM} cognitive control with verbal rehearsal of a random letter set led to increased distractor effects. These findings confirm load theory predictions and provide a novel functional distinction between the roles of {WM} maintenance and cognitive control in selective attention.}

abstract = {Young, novice drivers constitute a disproportionate percentage of fatalities and injuries in road traffic accidents around the world. This study, attempts to identify motivational factors behind risky driving behavior, and examines the role of personality, especially sensation seeking, impulsivity and sensitivity to punishment/reward in predicting negative driving outcomes (accident involvement and traffic offences) among young drivers. Gender and driver's age are additional factors examined in relation to driving outcomes and personality. Adopting the contextual mediated model of traffic accident involvement (Sümer, 2003), the study is based on the theory that personality, age and gender represent distal factors that predict accident involvement indirectly through their relationship with stable tendencies towards aberrant driving behavior. Results from correlations and Structural Equation Modeling using {AMOS} 6 indicated that direct personality effects on driving outcomes were few, whereas personality had significant correlations with aberrant driving behavior, showing that personality is a distal but important predictor of negative driving outcomes. These high risk traits appear to be at a peak among young male drivers. Thus, personality is important in understanding aggressive and risky driving by young adults and needs to be taken into consideration in designing targeted accident prevention policies.

abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Characterize the scale and pattern of long-term atrophy in gray matter ({GM}), white matter ({WM}), and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) in chronic moderate-severe traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) and its relationship to neurocognitive outcomes. {PARTICIPANTS}: The {TBI} group consisted of 17 males with primary diagnosis of moderate-severe closed head injury. Participants had not received any systematic, post-acute rehabilitation and were recruited on average 8.36 years post-injury. The control group consisted of 15 males matched on age and education. {MAIN} {MEASURES}: Neurocognitive battery included widely used tests of verbal memory, visual memory, executive functioning, and attention/organization. {GM}, {WM}, and {CSF} volumes were calculated from segmented T1-weighted anatomical {MR} images. Voxel-based morphometry was employed to identify brain regions with differences in {GM} and {WM} between {TBI} and control groups. {RESULTS}: Chronic {TBI} results in significant neurocognitive impairments, and significant loss of {GM} and {WM} volume, and significant increase in {CSF} volume. Brain atrophy is not widespread, but it is rather distributed in a fronto-thalamic network. The extent of volume loss is predictive of performance on the neurocognitive tests. {CONCLUSION}: Significant brain atrophy and associated neurocognitive impairments during the chronic stages of {TBI} support the notion that {TBI} results in a chronic condition with lifelong implications.}

abstract = {We contrasted the effects of different types of working memory ({WM}) load on detection. Considering the sensory-recruitment hypothesis of visual short-term memory ({VSTM}) within load theory (e.g., Lavie, 2010) led us to predict that {VSTM} load would reduce visual-representation capacity, thus leading to reduced detection sensitivity during maintenance, whereas load on {WM} cognitive control processes would reduce priority-based control, thus leading to enhanced detection sensitivity for a low-priority stimulus. During the retention interval of a {WM} task, participants performed a visual-search task while also asked to detect a masked stimulus in the periphery. Loading {WM} cognitive control processes (with the demand to maintain a random digit order [vs. fixed in conditions of low load]) led to enhanced detection sensitivity. In contrast, loading {VSTM} (with the demand to maintain the color and positions of six squares [vs. one in conditions of low load]) reduced detection sensitivity, an effect comparable with that found for manipulating perceptual load in the search task. The results confirmed our predictions and established a new functional dissociation between the roles of different types of {WM} load in the fundamental visual perception process of detection. 2013 {APA}, all rights reserved}

abstract = {{TBI} results in significant cognitive impairments and in altered brain functional connectivity. However, no studies explored so far, the relationship between global functional connectivity and cognitive outcome in chronic moderate-severe {TBI}. This proof of principle study employed the intrinsic connectivity contrast, an objective voxel-based metric of global functional connectivity, in a small sample of chronic moderate-severe {TBI} participants and a group of healthy controls matched on gender (males), age, and education. Cognitive tests assessing executive functions, verbal memory, visual memory, attention/organization, and cognitive reserve were administered. Group differences in terms of global functional connectivity maps were assessed and the association between performance on the cognitive measures and global functional connectivity was examined. Next, we investigated the spatial extent of functional connectivity in the brain regions found to be associated with cognitive performance, using traditional seed-based analyses. Global functional connectivity of the {TBI} group was altered, compared to the controls. Moreover, the strength of global functional connectivity in affected brain areas was associated with cognitive outcome. These findings indicate that impaired global functional connectivity is a significant consequence of {TBI} suggesting that cognitive impairments following {TBI} may be partly attributed to altered functional connectivity between brain areas involved in the specific cognitive functions.}

abstract = {The present study reports the findings of a 10-day neuronavigated continuous theta burst stimulation ({cTBS}) over the right pars triangularis for two individuals with chronic aphasia after a single left hemispheric stroke. Baseline language and quality of life measures were collected prior to the treatment study, post-treatment and at 3-month follow up. Therapy was tolerated well by both participants and no side effects were noticed during and after treatment. Results from one individual showed potential for positive change in performance in comprehension and expressive language both post-treatment and at the follow-up stage. Also, a trend towards improvement post-treatment was noticed in discourse and sentence productivity, and grammatical accuracy. In the follow up stage, grammatical accuracy showed a trend towards improvement; discourse productivity decreased and; sentence productivity skills showed mixed results. Results from the other participant showed potential for positive change in comprehension post-treatment, that was maintained at the follow-up stage. However, a decline in expressive language post-treatment and at follow-up, stronger post-treatment, was noticed. Regarding quality of life measurements, participant one appeared to have improved as his performance increased in the overall, physical and communication domains, but decreased slightly in the psychosocial domain. The second participant improved in the physical and communication domains and declined overall and in the psychosocial domains. Findings from this study indicate that {cTBS} over the right pars triangularis may have the potential to improve various language skills in patients suffering from chronic aphasia post-stroke. However, the potential benefits of this fast, non-invasive brain stimulation protocol on improvement of language abilities post-stroke need further exploration.}

abstract = {This research investigates the chronic effect of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury on brain white matter integrity, as reflected by diffusion tensor imaging metrics, and the assessment of their correlation to neuropsychological response. Thirteen male participants with traumatic brain injury (8.4 years average post-injury time) were compared to a matched group of neurologically healthy controls. None of the traumatic brain injury subjects had received post-acute neurocognitive and/or neuropsychological rehabilitation. Between-group comparison of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity was performed for the whole brain and corpus callosum. An extensive battery of visual and verbal memory tasks was employed for the comparative assessment of neurocognitive performance. Between-group and within-group performance differences were correlated with fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity of corpus callosum. Significant changes in global fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were associated with traumatic brain injury. Visual memory capacity was reduced in traumatic brain injury, and this deficit was correlated to white matter integrity loss at the corpus callosum. Participants with traumatic brain injury underperformed controls in verbal memory as well, but no correlation with corpus callosum diffusion tensor imaging properties was established. Betweengroup performance difference was correlated with corpus callosum diffusion metrics in several tasks. Significant correlations were found between corpus callosum diffusion tensor imaging metrics and neuropsychological response within the traumatic brain injury group. Changes in whole brain and corpus callosum diffusion tensor metrics inflicted by moderate to severe traumatic brain injury are still evident several years post-injury and relate to neurocognitive impairment, while loss of white matter integrity seems to correlate with episodic and working memory impairment. \copyright2019 Yiannakkaras et al.
